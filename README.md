# React Assessment for AVAMAE

This README provides instructions to set up and run the AVAMAE assessment web app.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## We will start here

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

   Your app will automatically launch at `http://localhost:3000/`.


Thank you.
